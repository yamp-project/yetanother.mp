      <h2>4. ABOUT THE DEDICATED SERVER ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
      <p>
        A dedicated server administrator is a user who creates, configures,
        manages, or operates a dedicated server through the game platform.
      </p>

      <h3>Operating conditions of a dedicated server</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>4.1</strong> The administrator is responsible for managing,
          moderating, and ensuring the smooth operation of their dedicated
          server and all associated spaces. It is their duty to implement
          minimum moderation measures to maintain a respectful and appropriate
          community environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.2</strong> It is prohibited to monetise a dedicated server
          by: virtual currency in exchange for real money, the commercialisation
          of loot boxes or similar mechanisms in return for real money,
          cryptocurrency, or in-game virtual currency, the operation of a server
          on behalf of a third-party brand or as part of a commercial
          partnership, the generation of income through sponsorships,
          endorsements, or the integration of third-party promotions or
          advertisements, and the facilitation of the use, sale, or promotion of
          cryptocurrencies or crypto assets. Any other forms of monetisation are
          not inherently allowed or prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.3</strong> It is forbidden to operate a dedicated server
          with the intent to deceive, manipulate, or exploit the trust of users
          for personal or fraudulent purposes. This includes, without
          limitation, the misuse of donations, the organisation of fictitious
          lotteries or fundraising campaigns, the sale of inaccurate or
          non-existent benefits or privileges, or any other form of scam or
          fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.4</strong> It is prohibited to state or imply, whether
          explicitly or implicitly, that a dedicated server is approved,
          recognised, certified, sponsored, supported, affiliated with, or owned
          by YAMP, Rockstar Games, or any of its subsidiaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.5</strong> Do not collect, share, or publish personal or
          sensitive information of any user without their explicit consent. This
          includes IP addresses, real names, locations, or any identifying data.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Dedicated server moderation policy</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>4.6</strong> Any dedicated server found to be non-compliant
          with these Terms will be subject to an official non-compliance notice,
          specifying the issues identified. The administrator will then be
          granted a timeframe – determined by the severity of the violation, to
          implement the necessary corrections. Unless the violation poses a
          serious risk (e.g. fraud, abuse, or harm), in which case immediate
          action may be taken without prior notice. Failure to do so will result
          in the permanent banning of the dedicated server and its
          administrators. YAMP administrators reserve the right to define what
          is classed as a "serious risk".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4.7</strong> In the event of a report that does not
          immediately establish a clear breach of these Terms, YAMP reserves the
          right to initiate a compliance review. The administrator of the
          dedicated server in question must fully cooperate with all reasonable
          requests made by YAMP to verify adherence to the conditions governing
          server operation. Failure to cooperate, non-compliance, or any attempt
          to obstruct the investigation may result in the immediate and
          precautionary suspension of all services associated with the server.
          Depending on the outcome of the review, the server owner may also be
          subject to additional penalties, including but not limited to account
          sanctions, service restrictions, or permanent removal from the
          platform.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. ABOUT THE USER GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
      <p>
        For the purposes of these Terms, user generated content refers to any
        virtual element created, integrated, or intended to be integrated into a
        dedicated server.
      </p>

      <h3>Intellectual property of user generated content</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>5.1</strong> All original content intended to be integrated
          into the associated services remains the exclusive property of its
          author, provided they are the legitimate creator and subject to the
          rights of third parties being respected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5.2</strong> We do not claim any ownership or exploitation
          rights over user generated content. However, you acknowledge that YAMP
          reserves a moderation right, allowing us to restrict access to, hide,
          or remove any content that does not comply with these Terms of Use.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>User generated content compliance conditions</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>5.3</strong> It is prohibited to use, integrate, depict, or
          distribute any content for which you do not hold the necessary usage
          rights. This includes, without limitation, registered trademarks,
          works protected by copyright, licensed visual or audio elements, and
          third-party user-generated content subject to intellectual property
          rights. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that the content
          they use complies with all applicable intellectual property rights. We
          disclaim any responsibility or liability for user content that
          violates such rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5.4</strong> It is prohibited to publish or promote any
          content designed in a way that causes significant instability,
          resource overload, abnormal behaviour of the dedicated server, or
          substantial degradation of the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5.5</strong> It is prohibited to publish, integrate, use,
          promote, or distribute any content of a paedopornographic nature, or
          that could reasonably be interpreted as encouraging, suggesting, or
          facilitating such use. This prohibition applies to any content that
          depicts, references, or sexualises minors, whether real or fictional,
          explicitly or implicitly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5.6</strong> It is prohibited to publish, integrate, use,
          promote, or distribute any content that refers to existing criminal,
          terrorist, or extremist organisations or individuals.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Monetization of user-generated content</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>5.7</strong> YAMP does not provide any space, service, or
          feature enabling the promotion, listing, or distribution of monetised
          content within the platform. Any commercial initiative is carried out
          independently, outside of our services, and under your sole
          responsibility.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>6. FINAL PROVISIONS</h2>
      <h3>Modification of the terms of use</h3>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>6.1</strong> YAMP reserves the right to modify these Terms of
          Use at any time. Any modification shall take effect upon its
          publication through our official communication channels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>6.2</strong> It is the responsibility of users to regularly
          consult the Terms of Use in order to remain informed of any potential
          changes. Continued use of the associated services after such
          publication shall constitute full and unconditional acceptance of the
          revised Terms. Failure to have read or acknowledged a modification
          shall under no circumstances be considered a valid ground for
          exemption or objection to its application.

        Yet Another M* Platform (YAMP) is an independent, nonprofit third-party
        modding project dedicated to delivering the best experiences.
      </p>

      <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        For us, <strong>modding</strong> means everything that can be created
        within a game—whether in single-player or multiplayer. We are driven by
        passion and a commitment to enhance the gaming experience for the
        community.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-semibold mb-6">
        What Are We Working On Exactly?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        We are currently developing a <strong>GTA&nbsp;V mod</strong> designed
        to enhance both single-player and multiplayer experiences. This is yet
        another third-party project, offering something truly different from
        existing projects.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        On the technical side, our goals include <em>server-side authority</em>,
        <em>rich APIs</em>, and <em>competitive synchronization</em> with high
        player loads.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-semibold mb-6">
        How Are We Different?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        The modding world is full of incredible projects led by passionate
        individuals. What sets us apart is our forward-thinking approach and our
        determination to make the community the center of our decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Players' and creators' expectations are evolving rapidly, and we believe
        we are well-positioned to meet them.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Key Focuses</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-white/80">
        <li><strong>Developer Experience</strong> – Rich APIs.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance</strong> – Ensuring smooth and optimized gameplay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Synchronization Quality</strong> – We chose not to rely on the
          game's netcode, as it was not designed to meet the modern standards we
          are aiming for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Experience</strong> – Making modding accessible to
          everyone, from modders and speedrunners to entire communities and
          newcomers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security</strong> – Prioritizing safety for both players with
          a built-in anticheat and developers with a by-design server-side
          authority.
        </li>
